            <p>I decided to deconstruct examples from stackoverflow and the jQuery docs and play with them to see why we need each part. Thought about it and jQuery is kinda easy. jQuery listens for events through handlers and executes function on target data structures, which often have arguments that must be specified so it knows exactly what kind of changes we are looking for. For example, if someone says, "When I say jump, I want you to ask: 'How high?'" Our listener are our ears, the function is "jump," the target data structure is "I," and the parameter that must be specified by an argument is, of course, "high," hence, obviously, "How high?" with "how" as a prompt. Thinking about programs as living organisms makes things easier and a bit more amusing, because then coding becomes almost like a conversation with a partner or spouse -- loving and rewarding -- albeit, one you have to watch your mouth around, because, well, you have a big mouth and, otherwise, you'd get yelled at by the debugger for saying the wrong things . . . . </p>

            <p>I decided that I understood the syntax well enough to just move on beyond slideDown, slideUp, and slideToggle!</p>
